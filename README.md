# C Perceptron

Perceptron implemented in C. Motivation was to cement my understanding of AI 
concepts and to explore the C language.

To use, clone the repo and run `bash buildAndRun.sh`.

The perceptron will be trained for 20 epochs on a shuffled and standardized 
Iris Dataset. The accuracy and a confusion matrix will be printed to the 
console after each epoch.
